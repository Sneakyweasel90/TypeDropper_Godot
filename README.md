#Type Dropper

This is a Typeing game that I had developed using pygame a little awhile ago. I decided to make a change and use a game maker because it will be a lot easier in the long run to make changes and add updates to it.

I am constantly thinking of new ways to make the game more enjoyable as well!

If you want to add some requests please message me or take a look at the project board for this game
